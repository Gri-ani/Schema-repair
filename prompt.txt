You are an expert in analyzing and validating join relationships between two database tables 
for a given natural language query.

You will be provided with:
- A *query* in natural language,
- The *schemas* of two tables,
- A set of *join candidates*, where:
  - Each table pair key is formatted as: db_id#sep#table1-db_id#sep#table2
  - Each column pair key is formatted as: db_id#sep#table1#sep#column1-db_id#sep#table2#sep#column2

Your goal is to determine whether any of the given join candidates represent a *valid join*
 that can correctly answer the query.

Respond using exactly *two lines*:
- Line 1: Explanation
- Line 2: Output "YES" if at least one join candidate is valid, otherwise "NO"

=====================
Query: "{query_text}"

Table Schema for {table_key1.split('#sep#')[-1]}:
{schema1_str}

Table Schema for {table_key2.split('#sep#')[-1]}:

Join Candidates:

=============================
        OBJECTIVE:
=============================
You are an expert at analyzing natural-language queries
and validating whether the provided join candidates between
two tables are valid to answer the query.
=============================
        INPUT:
=============================
1. A natural language query posed by the user.
2. The database schema for two table.
3. A list of possible join candidates between these two tables, formatted as column pairs (e.g., TableA.columnX, TableB.columnY)
and a combined score(weighted sum of ) and jaccard score of the instances.
4. A list of entities(sub-queries) mentioned in the query
============================
        Output
============================
Return a json dictionary with the following keys
{
  "intent_summary": Brief explanation of what the user is asking for.
  "entities_relation": Give the relationships between the entities.
  "join_validity": YES/NO
  "rationale": whether any of the given join candidates actually shows the relationship between the entities
}
============================
       CONSTRAINTS
============================
Think step by step:  
1. Understand the query and what information it is asking for.  
2. Look at the schemas of both tables.  
3. Check the given possible join candidates.  
4. Based on the entities given find the relationship between the entities
5. Based on the relationship between the entities see if any join actually shows that relationship or not
4. Decide if the query can actually be answered by using any of those joins and answer "Yes" or n"No" 

Do not assume anything outside the given information.

    ONE SHOT EXAMPLE
=============================
Query: "what is the expense for category food for the september meeting event?"

Table Schema for expense:  
Table: expense  
Columns: expense_id, expense_date, cost, link_to_budget  

Table Schema for budget:  
Table: budget  
Columns: budget_id, category, spent, remaining, amount, event_status, event_name  

Possible joins between tables student_club#sep#budget and student_club#sep#expense are represented as:  
"db_id#sep#table_name#sep#column_name - db_id#sep#table_name#sep#column_name"  

{
  "student_club#sep#budget#sep#budget_id - student_club#sep#expense#sep#link_to_budget": {
    "join_category": "inferred PK-FK",
    "combined_score": 0.6723837485680213
  },
  "student_club#sep#budget#sep#spent - student_club#sep#expense#sep#cost": {
    "join_category": "Semantic",
    "combined_score": 0.5188322831844462
  }
}








=============================
        OBJECTIVE:
=============================
You are an expert at analyzing natural-language database queries
and validating whether a given join candidate between two tables
represents a logically valid and relevant relationship needed 
to address (fully or partially) the user’s query.

=============================
        INPUT:
=============================
1. Query: A natural-language question posed by the user.  
2. Schemas: Database schemas for two tables, including table names and their columns.  
3. Join Candidates: A list of possible join column pairs between the two tables, each with metadata such as:
   - combined_score (weighted or similarity-based)
   - jaccard_score (instance overlap similarity)
4. Entities:A list of key entities or sub-queries extracted from the user’s query.

=============================
        TASK
=============================
Determine whether any of the provided join candidates
captures the **intended relationship between the entities** mentioned in the query.  
Note: The join does not need to fully answer the query — it only needs to
represent the correct **linkage between the two tables involved** in that part of the query.

=============================
    OUTPUT FORMAT
=============================
Return a JSON object with the following keys:

{
  "intent_summary": "<Brief explanation of what the user is asking for.>",
  "entities_relation": "<Explain the logical relationship between the entities as described in the query.>",
  "join_validity": "YES/NO",
  "rationale": "<Explain whether any of the given join candidates aligns with the entity relationship and why it does or does not.>"
}

=============================
    REASONING CONSTRAINTS
=============================
Follow this reasoning process step-by-step:

1. Understand Intent:
   Summarize what the user wants to know — e.g., a value lookup, aggregation, or relationship exploration.

2. Identify Entities and Tables: 
   Determine which entities (terms or concepts) map to which tables.

3. Interpret Relationship:
   Understand how these entities are related conceptually (e.g., “expenses belong to budgets,” “students enroll in courses,” etc.).

4. Analyze Given Joins: 
   Review each join candidate to see if it reflects that conceptual relationship.

5. Assess Sufficiency (Partial Validity Allowed):  
   The join is valid if it expresses the correct linkage between the two relevant entities or tables, even if other tables or joins might be needed for the full query.

6. Make Decision:
   If at least one join candidate logically expresses that relationship, set `"join_validity": "YES"`. Otherwise, `"NO"`.

Do not assume any hidden columns, implicit keys, or extra tables beyond what is provided.**
Only use the given schemas, entities, and join candidates.

        EXAMPLE
=============================
Query:  
"What is the expense for category food for the September meeting event?"

**Table Schemas:**  
Table: expense  
Columns: expense_id, expense_date, cost, link_to_budget  

Table: budget  
Columns: budget_id, category, spent, remaining, amount, event_status, event_name  

Possible Joins:
{
  "student_club#sep#budget#sep#budget_id - student_club#sep#expense#sep#link_to_budget": {
    "join_category": "inferred PK-FK",
    "combined_score": 0.6723837485680213
  },
  "student_club#sep#budget#sep#spent - student_club#sep#expense#sep#cost": {
    "join_category": "Semantic",
    "combined_score": 0.5188322831844462
  }
}

Output:
{
  "intent_summary": "The user wants to find the total expense (cost) for the category 'food' associated with the 'September meeting' event.",
  "entities_relation": "The query connects 'expense' records with 'budget' entries that define event and category information. Each expense is linked to a specific budget entry.",
  "join_validity": "YES",
  "rationale": "The join 'budget.budget_id - expense.link_to_budget' correctly represents the relationship between expenses and budgets, enabling partial fulfillment of the query by linking expenses to their associated event and category data."
}

Analyze Given Joins: Review each join candidate to see if it reflects that conceptual relationship. Also note that just because a join can be done and has a high score doesn't mean it is actually a correct join to be done for that query. Joinability is subject to the query.

Make Decision: If at least one join candidate shows the actual relationship. For this see if existing column is actually correct or some other column would capture that actual relationship?

"join_validity": "YES" if existing column can capture the relationship

"NO", if some other column should be added to capture the exact relationship
